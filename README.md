Final project for completion of the Google Data Analytics Course

There are 6 steps to the Data Analysis Journey

  1. The ASK phase 
The Business task at hand which is to determine 
"How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclitic bikes differently?"

  2. The PREPARE phase
The data that was collected was directly from the source, making it a reputable source. The data included things such as bike type, ride id, as well as the
longitude and latitude of where the ride began and ended. There was no bias within the data however, it is worth noting that the data did include a start station name 
along with an end station name. Those columns had to be removed due to a multitude of those values not provided within the monthly data.
  
  3. The PROCESS phase
Being that the data was collected over the course of a full year, the data was provided in 12 individual spreadsheets representing their respective months. First thing
I did was to organize the data to where all 12 months were represented on one table. 
This is the phase where I went through and scrubbed the data for any anomalies or null vales as mentioned above. Was still able to compute the distance traveled for
each ride using the start and end longitudes and latitudes provided in the data sets.

  4. The ANALYZE Phase
This is the fun part, where I get to create queries and find patterns within the dataset. Queries were created using Big Query with SQL. Then the different tables created
were imported into Tableau. I was able to create a few very impactful visuals to answer the question of how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic Bikes differently.

  5. The SHARE Phase
The PowerPoint link along with the visuals will be placed in a separate location to access
Key findings: 
-No annual members used the bike type 'Docked Bike' in 2022
-Electric Bikes are used for longer distances
-Member usage is highest Monday-Friday
-Casual usage is highest Saturday and Sunday
-Both Casual and Member usage is at its all-time high during the months of Summer

  6. The ACT Phase
